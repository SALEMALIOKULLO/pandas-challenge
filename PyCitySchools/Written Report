##### To receive all points, the written report presents a cohesive written analysis that:
#- Summarizes the analysis
#- Draws two correct conclusions or comparisons from the calculations
    
#The analysis in terms of reading and math skills is percise but other key features that attribute to performances are not as clear. 
#Some examples include, the amount of teachers to student ratio, other school subjects like history and science, socio-economic background and location of the schoools, teachers' teaching experience.
#Such information would help explain why schools have different skill sets and attributes.     
    
    
    # Observation 1:  Charter schools outperformed the District schools. Overall there is a 90% passing rate (in Math and Reading skills) in the Charter schools, 
#compared to an almost 74% proficiency in the District schools. For both these types of schools, passing students seem to have greater proficiency in Reading than Mathematics.
    #Observation 2:  Overall, reading skills are more found to be more enhanced than math skills for both Charter and District schools. This is true perspective when you analyze the size of the schools, the spending done on the schools
#and even the size of the schools(determined by the total number of students).
